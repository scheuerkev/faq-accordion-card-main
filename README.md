Please mind that production code is transpiled, minified and postfixed. If you want to have a look on originals sources code please visit it under : 
- /sass => Sass files (7-1 pattern)
- /js/index.js => Original ES6 source code

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS Vanilla ES6

### What I learned

I've learned a lot in difference between html image and image background component. Think it was trickier than I've presumed. As always the workflow media querries, flexbox and grid combinations show all its simplicity imo.
